# Operating Systems - Assignment 4

## Motivation
My team and I make the unanimous decision that it is in our best interest to complete this assignment so that we may get a good grade in this course. So here we are.
## Installation
*Requirements: Code must be compiled and executed on Linux systems.*
1. Download the repository locally onto your system
2. Make sure that files are stored on a Linux system (or accessible by a Linux VM)
3. Create the Makefile using the following command
    ```bash
    mv makefile.mk Makefile
    ```
4. Compile the program and treat warnings as fatal:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    Or compile with warnings enabled, but not fatal
    ```bash
    make warnings_OK
    ```
5. Run the program using
    ```bash
    ./Assignment_4 a b c ... y z
    ```
    Where ```a, b, c, ..., y, z``` are appropriate parameters
